# Silly animating static background
Animating static background in Gnome. Very slight animation at the cost of some
resources (not terribly too much but too much), intriguing looking but not
distracting. 

### Installation and usage
Very basic installation and operation instructions but you should know how to do
this, its more a morbid curisity more than anything else. 

```
go get
go build
cd static ./generate-static.sh & cd .. 
./start.sh
```
